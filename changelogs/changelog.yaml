      breaking_changes:
      - mysql_replication - remove ``Is_Slave`` and ``Is_Master`` return values (were
        replaced with ``Is_Primary`` and ``Is_Replica`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections    /community.mysql/issues/145).
      - mysql_replication - remove the mode options values containing ``master``/``slave``
        and the master_use_gtid option ``slave_pos`` (were replaced with corresponding
        ``primary``/``replica`` values) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/145).
      - mysql_user - remove support for the `REQUIRESSL` special privilege as it has
        ben superseded by the `tls_requires` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/discussions/121).
      - mysql_user - validate privileges using database engine directly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/234
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/243). Do not validate
        privileges in this module anymore.

  3.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Collection core functions - use vendored version of ``distutils.version``
        instead of the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/269).
      minor_changes:
      - Added explicit description of the supported versions of databases and connectors.
        Changes to the collection are **NOT** tested against database versions older
        than `mysql 5.7.31` and `mariadb 10.2.37` or connector versions older than
        `pymysql 0.7.10` and `mysqlclient 2.0.1`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/discussions/141)
      - mysql_user - added the ``force_context`` boolean option to set the default
        database context for the queries to be the ``mysql`` database. This way replication/binlog
        filters can catch the statements (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/265).

      bugfixes:
      - mysql_replication - fails when using the `primary_use_gtid` option with `slave_pos`
        or `replica_pos` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/335).
      - mysql_role - remove redundant connection closing (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/330).
      - 'mysql_user - fix the possibility for a race condition that breaks certain
        (circular) replication configurations when ``DROP USER`` is executed on multiple
        nodes in the replica set. Adding ``IF EXISTS`` avoids the need to use ``sql_log_bin:
        no`` making the statement always replication safe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/287).'

  3.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - mysql_user - fix missing dynamic privileges after revoke and grant privileges
        to user (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/120).
      - mysql_user - fix parsing privs when a user has roles assigned (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/231).
      major_changes:
      - The community.mysql collection no longer supports ``Ansible 2.9`` and ``ansible-base
        2.10``. While we take no active measures to prevent usage and there are no
        plans to introduce incompatible code to the modules, we will stop testing
        against ``Ansible 2.9`` and ``ansible-base 2.10``. Both will very soon be
        End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading
        to the ``latest Ansible / ansible-core 2.11 or later`` as soon as possible
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/343).
      minor_changes:
      - 'mysql_user and mysql_role: Add the argument ``subtract_privs`` (boolean,
        default false, mutually exclusive with ``append_privs``). If set, the privileges
        given in ``priv`` are revoked and existing privileges are kept (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/333).'
