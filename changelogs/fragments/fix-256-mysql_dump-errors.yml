bugfixes:
  - mysql_db - Using compression masks errors messages from
    mysql_dump. By default the fix is inactive to ensure retro-compatibility
    with system without bash. To activate the fix, use the module option
    ``pipefail=true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/256).
