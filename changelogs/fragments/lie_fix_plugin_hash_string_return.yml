bugfixes:
  - mysql_info - Add ``plugin_hash_string`` to ``users_info`` filter's output. The existing ``plugin_auth_string`` contained the hashed password and thus is missleading, it will be removed from community.mysql 4.0.0. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/629).

breaking_changes:
  - mysql_info - The ``users_info`` filter returned variable ``plugin_auth_string`` contains the hashed password and it's misleading, it will be removed from community.mysql 4.0.0. Use the `plugin_hash_string` return value instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/629).
