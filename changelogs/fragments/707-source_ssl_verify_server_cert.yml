bugfixes:
  - mysql_replication - fixed an issue where setting ``primary_ssl_verify_server_cert`` to false had no effect (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/689).

minor_changes:
  - mysql_replication - change default value for ``primary_ssl_verify_server_cert`` from False to None. This should not affect existing playbooks (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/707).
