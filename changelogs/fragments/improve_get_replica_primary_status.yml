minor_changes:

  - mysql_replication - Improve detection of IsReplica and IsPrimary by inspecting the dictionary returned from the SQL query instead of relying on variable types. This ensures compatibility with changes in the connector or the output of SHOW REPLICA STATUS and SHOW MASTER STATUS, allowing for easier maintenance if these change in the future.
