major_changes:

  - The community.mysql collection no longer supports ``ansible-core 2.12`` and
    ``ansible-core 2.13``. While we take no active measures to prevent usage
    and there are no plans to introduce incompatible code to the modules, we
    will stop testing those versions. Both are or will soon be End of Life and
    if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading to the
    ``latest Ansible / ansible-core 2.15 or later`` as soon as possible
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/574).
