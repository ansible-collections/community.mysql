      breaking_changes:
      - mysql_replication - remove ``Is_Slave`` and ``Is_Master`` return values (were
        replaced with ``Is_Primary`` and ``Is_Replica`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/145).
      - mysql_replication - remove the mode options values containing ``master``/``slave``
        and the master_use_gtid option ``slave_pos`` (were replaced with corresponding
        ``primary``/``replica`` values) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/145).
      - mysql_user - remove support for the `REQUIRESSL` special privilege as it has
        ben superseded by the `tls_requires` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/discussions/121).
      - mysql_user - validate privileges using database engine directly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/234
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/243). Do not validate
        privileges in this module anymore.

  3.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Collection core functions - use vendored version of ``distutils.version``
        instead of the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/269).
      minor_changes:
      - Added explicit description of the supported versions of databases and connectors.
        Changes to the collection are **NOT** tested against database versions older
        than `mysql 5.7.31` and `mariadb 10.2.37` or connector versions older than
        `pymysql 0.7.10` and `mysqlclient 2.0.1`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/discussions/141)
      - mysql_user - added the ``force_context`` boolean option to set the default
        database context for the queries to be the ``mysql`` database. This way replication/binlog
        filters can catch the statements (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/265).

        (circular) replication configurations when ``DROP USER`` is executed on multiple
        nodes in the replica set. Adding ``IF EXISTS`` avoids the need to use ``sql_log_bin:

      - mysql_user - fix missing dynamic privileges after revoke and grant privileges
        to user (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/120).
      - mysql_user - fix parsing privs when a user has roles assigned (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/231).
      major_changes:
      - The community.mysql collection no longer supports ``Ansible 2.9`` and ``ansible-base
        2.10``. While we take no active measures to prevent usage and there are no
        plans to introduce incompatible code to the modules, we will stop testing
        against ``Ansible 2.9`` and ``ansible-base 2.10``. Both will very soon be
        End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading
        to the ``latest Ansible / ansible-core 2.11 or later`` as soon as possible
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/343).
      minor_changes:
      - 'mysql_user and mysql_role: Add the argument ``subtract_privs`` (boolean,
        default false, mutually exclusive with ``append_privs``). If set, the privileges
        given in ``priv`` are revoked and existing privileges are kept (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/333).'

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - mysql_query - fix false change reports when ``IF EXISTS/IF NOT EXISTS`` clause
        is used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/268).
      - 'mysql_role - don''t add members to a role when creating the role and ``detach_members:
        true`` is set (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/367).'
      - 'mysql_role - in some cases (when "SHOW GRANTS" did not use backticks for
        quotes), no unwanted members were detached from the role (and redundant "GRANT"
        statements were executed for wanted members). This is fixed by querying the
        existing role members from the mysql.role_edges (MySQL) or mysql.roles_mapping
        (MariaDB) tables instead of parsing the "SHOW GRANTS" output (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/368).

        '
      - mysql_user - fix logic when ``update_password`` is set to ``on_create`` for
        users using ``plugin*`` arguments (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/334).
        The ``on_create`` sets ``password`` to None for old mysql_native_authentication
        but not for authentiation methods which uses the ``plugin*`` arguments. This
        PR changes this so ``on_create`` also exchange ``plugin``, ``plugin_hash_string``,
        ``plugin_auth_string`` to None in the list of arguments to change
      minor_changes:
      - 'mysql_role - add the argument ``members_must_exist`` (boolean, default true).
        The assertion that the users supplied in the ``members`` argument exist is
        only executed when the new argument ``members_must_exist`` is ``true``, to
        allow opt-out (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/369).

        '
      - 'mysql_user - Add the option ``on_new_username`` to argument ``update_password``
        to reuse the password (plugin and authentication_string) when creating a new
        user if some user with the same name already exists. If the existing user
        with the same name have varying passwords, the password from the arguments
        is used like with ``update_password: always`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/365).

        '
      - 'mysql_user - Add the result field ``password_changed`` (boolean). It is true,
        when the user got a new password. When the user was created with ``update_password:
        on_new_username`` and an existing password was reused, ``password_changed``
        is false (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/365).

  3.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Include ``simplified_bsd.txt`` license file for various module utils.
      - mysql_db - Using compression masks errors messages from mysql_dump. By default
        the fix is inactive to ensure retro-compatibility with system without bash.
        To activate the fix, use the module option ``pipefail=true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/256).
      - mysql_replication - when the ``primary_ssl`` argument is set to ``no``, the
        module will turn off SSL (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/393).
      major_changes:
      - mysql_db - the ``pipefail`` argument's default value will be changed to ``true``
        in community.mysql 4.0.0. If your target machines do not use ``bash`` as a
        default interpreter, set ``pipefail`` to ``false`` explicitly. However, we
        strongly recommend setting up ``bash`` as a default and ``pipefail=true``
        as it will protect you from getting broken dumps you don't know about (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/407).
      minor_changes:
      - mysql_db - add the ``chdir`` argument to avoid failings when a dump file contains
        relative paths (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/395).
      - mysql_db - add the ``pipefail`` argument to avoid broken dumps when ``state``
        is ``dump`` and compression is used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/256).

        fix revokes grant option only when privs are setup to do that (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/77#issuecomment-1209693807).

  3.5.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - mysql_user, mysql_role - mysql/mariadb recent versions translate 'ALL PRIVILEGES'
        to a list of specific privileges. That caused a change every time we modified
        user privileges. This fix compares privs before and after user modification
        to avoid this infinite change (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/77).

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - mysql_user - when revoke privs consists only of ``GRANT``, a 2nd revoke query
        is executed with empty privs to revoke that ended in an SQL exception (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/503).
      - mysql_variables - add uppercase character pattern to regex to allow GLOBAL
        variables containing uppercase characters. This recognizes variable names
        used in Galera, for example, ``wsrep_OSU_method``, which breaks the normal
        pattern of all lowercase characters (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/501).
      minor_changes:
      - mysql_info - add ``connector_name`` and ``connector_version`` to returned
        values (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/497).
      - mysql_role - enable auto_commit to avoid MySQL metadata table lock (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/479).
      - mysql_user - add plugin_auth_string as optional parameter to use a specific
        pam service if pam/auth_pam plugin is used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/445).
      - mysql_user - add the ``session_vars`` argument to set session variables at
        the beginning of module execution (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/478).
      - mysql_user - display a more informative invalid privilege exception. Changes
        the exception handling of the granting permission logic to show the query
        executed , params and the exception message granting privileges fails` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/465).
      - mysql_user - enable auto_commit to avoid MySQL metadata table lock (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/479).
