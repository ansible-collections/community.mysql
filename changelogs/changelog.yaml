      breaking_changes:
      - mysql_replication - remove ``Is_Slave`` and ``Is_Master`` return values (were

      - mysql_replication - remove the mode options values containing ``master``/``slave``
        and the master_use_gtid option ``slave_pos`` (were replaced with corresponding
        ``primary``/``replica`` values) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/145).
      - mysql_user - remove support for the `REQUIRESSL` special privilege as it has
        ben superseded by the `tls_requires` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/discussions/121).
      - mysql_user - validate privileges using database engine directly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/234
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/243). Do not validate
        privileges in this module anymore.

  3.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Collection core functions - use vendored version of ``distutils.version``
        instead of the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/269).
      minor_changes:
      - Added explicit description of the supported versions of databases and connectors.
        Changes to the collection are **NOT** tested against database versions older
        than `mysql 5.7.31` and `mariadb 10.2.37` or connector versions older than
        `pymysql 0.7.10` and `mysqlclient 2.0.1`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/discussions/141)
      - mysql_user - added the ``force_context`` boolean option to set the default
        database context for the queries to be the ``mysql`` database. This way replication/binlog
        filters can catch the statements (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/265).

      bugfixes:

        or `replica_pos` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/335).
      - mysql_role - remove redundant connection closing (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/330).
      - 'mysql_user - fix the possibility for a race condition that breaks certain
        (circular) replication configurations when ``DROP USER`` is executed on multiple
        nodes in the replica set. Adding ``IF EXISTS`` avoids the need to use ``sql_log_bin:
        no`` making the statement always replication safe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/287).'
