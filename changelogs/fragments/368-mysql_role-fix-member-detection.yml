    mysql_role - in some cases (when "SHOW GRANTS" did not use backticks for quotes), no unwanted members were detached
    from the role (and redundant "GRANT" statements were executed for wanted members). This is fixed by querying the
    existing role members from the mysql.role_edges (MySQL) or mysql.roles_mapping (MariaDB) tables instead of parsing
    the "SHOW GRANTS" output (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/368).
