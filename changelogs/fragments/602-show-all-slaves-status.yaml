bugfixes:
  - slave_status - The mysql_info returns an empty list for slave_status when using MariaDB with multiple named replication channels/sources. Fix now returns all replication channels/sources on MariaDB by running `SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS` when the server is MariaDB (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/603).
