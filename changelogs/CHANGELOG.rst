Community MySQL Collection Release Notes
========================================

.. contents:: Topics

This changelog describes changes after version 2.0.0.

v3.1.3
======

Release Summary
---------------

This is the patch release of the ``community.mysql`` collection.
This changelog contains all changes to the modules in this collection
that have been added after the release of ``community.mysql`` 3.1.2.

Bugfixes
--------

- mysql_replication - fails when using the `primary_use_gtid` option with `slave_pos` or `replica_pos` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/335).
- mysql_role - remove redundant connection closing (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/330).
- mysql_user - fix the possibility for a race condition that breaks certain (circular) replication configurations when ``DROP USER`` is executed on multiple nodes in the replica set. Adding ``IF EXISTS`` avoids the need to use ``sql_log_bin: no`` making the statement always replication safe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/287).

v3.1.2
======

Release Summary
---------------

This is the patch release of the ``community.mysql`` collection.
This changelog contains all changes to the modules in this collection

v3.1.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

This is the patch release of the ``community.mysql`` collection.
This changelog contains all changes to the modules in this collection
that have been added after the release of ``community.mysql`` 3.1.0.

Bugfixes
--------

- mysql_role - make the ``set_default_role_all`` parameter actually working (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/282).

v3.1.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

This is the minor release of the ``community.mysql`` collection.
This changelog contains all changes to the modules in this collection
that have been added after the release of ``community.mysql`` 3.0.0.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Added explicit description of the supported versions of databases and connectors. Changes to the collection are **NOT** tested against database versions older than `mysql 5.7.31` and `mariadb 10.2.37` or connector versions older than `pymysql 0.7.10` and `mysqlclient 2.0.1`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/discussions/141)
- mysql_user - added the ``force_context`` boolean option to set the default database context for the queries to be the ``mysql`` database. This way replication/binlog filters can catch the statements (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/265).

Bugfixes
--------

- Collection core functions - use vendored version of ``distutils.version`` instead of the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/269).

v3.0.0
======

---------------

This is the major release of the ``community.mysql`` collection.
