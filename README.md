This collection is a part of the Ansible package.

## Our mission

The Ansible `community.mysql` collection goals are to produce and maintain simple,
flexible, and powerful open-source software for automating MySQL and MariaDB related tasks
providing good documentation for easy deployment and use.

### Databases

For MariaDB, only Long Term releases are tested. When multiple LTS are available, we test the oldest and the newest only. Usually breaking changes introduced in the versions in between are also present in the latest version.

- mysql 5.7.40 (collection version < 3.10.0)
- mysql 8.0.31 (collection version < 3.10.0)
- mysql 8.4.1 (collection version >= 3.10.0) !!! FAILING, no support yet !!!

- mariadb:10.4.24 (collection version >= 3.5.2, < 3.10.0)
- mariadb:10.5.18 (collection version >= 3.5.2, < 3.10.0)

- pymysql 0.10.1 (for RHEL8 context)
- pymysql 1.0.2 (collection version >= 3.6.1)
- pymysql 1.1.1 (collection version >= 3.10.0)

## External requirements

The MySQL modules rely on a [PyMySQL](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL) connector.

The `mysqlclient` connector support has been [deprecated](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/654) - use `PyMySQL` connector instead! We will stop testing against it in collection version 4.0.0 and remove the related code in 5.0.0.

## Using this collection

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using the MySQL collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.mysql
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.mysql
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically if you upgrade the Ansible package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.mysql --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.mysql:==2.0.0
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.
