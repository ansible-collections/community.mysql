  - >
    mysql_user - Add the option ``on_new_username`` to argument ``update_password`` to reuse the password (plugin and
    authentication_string) when creating a new user if some user with the same name already exists.
    If the existing user with the same name have varying passwords, the password from the arguments is used like with
    ``update_password: always`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/365).
  - >
    mysql_user - Add the result field ``password_changed`` (boolean). It is true, when the user got a new password.
    When the user was created with ``update_password: on_new_username`` and an existing password was reused,
    ``password_changed`` is false (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/365).
